Copying design from dribbble to show can create a site off of a mockup.

Built with purpose of only mockup so computer screen width 1024 x 810.

Site is responsive although dribbble mockup was only for desktop screens so design in responsive screens such as mobile size was made intuitively rather than following a design.
